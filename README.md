# Klevu JSv2 Early Adopters Programme

_**Last updated: 24th June 2019, beta v0.1.1.**_

This short introduction programme will take you from _nothing_ to a Shopify store
using Klevu Search with our new JavaScript Library Version 2, in around 10-15 minutes.
We will then introduce some further examples to help you understand more about the power of JSv2.

_Note: this is a beta version of JSv2 and we expect some changes to occur,
which will also be based on feedback from early adopters like yourselves,
so please bear this in mind during testing._

## Shopify? What about Magento 2, React, Vue, Drupal, etc.?

The first set of tutorials use the Shopify ecommerce platform,
however Klevu JSv2 is platform agnostic and Shopify is used due to the ease of getting started.
You can apply any lessons learnt in these tutorials to your own framework of choice.

## Tell us what you think!

This is just a brief introduction to how changes can be made with JSv2.

There are countless applications of Klevu APIv2 and JSv2 which we will be
detailing more and more as we grow our documentation, tutorials and user guides.
For the time being take a look at the snippets weâ€™ve provided,
the source code and templates and see what you think as an initial impression.

Please forward any feedback you may have to your Klevu contact
(_the person that told you about this programme_).

**Thank you!**
