# Layouts

These layouts contain combinations of the various 
[modules you will find within this repository](/modules).

Layouts give you an example of how to bundle together various
functionality into a simple folder/file structure.

Similar to the [getting started](/getting-started) guides,
they also serve as a good way to see Klevu JS Library in action very quickly.
