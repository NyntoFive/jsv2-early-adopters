# Hello World Tutorial in any framework

This example uses primarily static HTML, JS and CSS to showcase Klevu JS Library.
A tiny bit of PHP is used in order to include the micro-templates,
but you can use any approach you like to achieve the same outcome.

## Integrate Klevu JS Library with static HTML

First create a web accessible folder for you to copy the HTML files.

In the resources folder we have included an
[example implementation](/getting-started/1-hello-world/custom/resources)
for getting up and running with static HTML.

Copy these files to your folder, load up the index.php in your browser and
**try searching for "bag"**.

## Make some Changes!

Now you have Klevu functionality entirely hosted on your own infrastructure
and are ready to make some more changes to customise your search results!
