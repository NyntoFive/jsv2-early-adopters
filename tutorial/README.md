# Klevu JSv2 Early Adopters Programme

Last updated: 24th June 2019, beta v0.1.1.

This short introduction programme will take you from _nothing_ to a Shopify store
using Klevu Search with our new JavaScript Library Version 2, in around 10-15 minutes.
We will then introduce some further examples to help you understand more about the power of JSv2.

_Note: this is a beta version of JSv2 and we expect some changes to occur,
which will also be based on feedback from early adopters like yourselves,
so please bear this in mind during testing._

The first set of tutorials use the Shopify ecommerce platform,
however JSv2 is platform agnostic and Shopify is only used due to the ease of getting started.
You can apply any lessons learnt in this tutorial to your Magento, Drupal, React, Vue project.
